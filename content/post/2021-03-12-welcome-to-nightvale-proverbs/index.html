<p>Following a recommendation from a friend, I recently got really into the wonderfully weird and often outright bizarre world of the Welcome to Night Vale podcast. From Wikipedia:<span class="sidenote-number"></span><span class="sidenote">See <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_to_Night_Vale">here</a>.</span> “<em>Welcome to Night Vale is a podcast presented as a radio show for the fictional town of Night Vale, reporting on the strange events that occur within it.</em>”</p>
<p>One of my favourite parts of the show comes right at the very end, when the credit announcer reads out “today’s proverb”. These are without fail very strange, but always give me laugh. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s not the size of the dog in the fight, it’s the size of the other dog in the fight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inspired by other fun R packages such as <code>fortunes</code><span class="sidenote-number"></span><span class="sidenote">See <a href = "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fortunes/index.html">here</a>.</span>, I wanted to create a function that would print a random, nicely formatted WTNV proverb. Additionally, I was keen to practice my webscraping and data-cleaning, and this was a nice little problem to play around with.</p>
<div id="getting-the-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Getting the data</h2>
<p>Fortunately, some more diligent fans than I have already spent some time extracting the proverbs into a table, available from the WTNV Fandom site.<span class="sidenote-number"></span><span class="sidenote">See <a href = "https://nightvale.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Proverbs">here</a>.</span></p>
<p>My first step was to scrap the data from this table into R, by passing the <code>tr</code> class (used to define a row in a HTML table) to the <code>extract_nodes()</code> function of <code>rvest</code>, and then extracting the text contained in these elements.</p>
<p><label for="tufte-mn-" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">I used the <code>annotater</code> package to automagically create the descriptions of each package.</span></p>

## [2] &quot;1\n\n\&quot;Pilot\&quot;\n\n15 June 2012\n&quot;

<p>This gives us a character string of 396 elements, where each element is a unique row in the table. This presented two immediate problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The way the table is laid out, the information for each episode is split across two rows, and so I need to extract every odd and even element seperately and then rejoin them to create the proper dataset.</li>
<li>Multiple variables (the episode number, title and airdate) are contained within a single element of the vector (e.g. ‘1\n\n“Pilot”\n\n15 June 2012\n’).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cleaning the data</h2>
<div id="meta-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Meta-data</h3>
<p>I decided to start with the slightly harder task of cleaning the episode meta-data (number, title and airdate) first.</p>
<p>Having removed the header row (<code>tab[-1]</code>), I converted the vector to a dataframe and extracted every odd row (once I removed the header, the meta-data went from being on every even row to every odd row), making use of the <code>slice()</code> and <code>row_number()</code> functions from <code>dplyr</code>.</p>
<p>After this, I removed information on the proverbs from the live shows, which are presented in a second table at the end of the scraped webpage, by removing all rows after (and including) the row containing the header for that table.</p>
<p>I then needed to deal with the fact that three variables were contained in a single column in the dataframe. Fortunately, the variables were consistently seperated by a common delimiter (“\n\n”) which allowed me to use <code>separate()</code> from <code>tidyr</code> to split the single column into three new variables.</p>
<p>Finally, I removed all quotation marks from the three new variables,<span class="sidenote-number"></span><span class="sidenote">I appreciate this could be done in one step using <code>dplyr::across()</code>, but R kept hanging when I tried it and it wasn’t the focus of this project, so I moved on!</span> and removed the trailing newline charater from <code>airdate</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>meta &lt;- tab[-1] %&gt;%

  # Remove live shows
  slice(1:which(.$number == &quot;Show No.\n\nTitle\n\nRelease Date\n&quot;) - 1) %&gt;%
  # Split into component parts
  separate(number,
           c(&quot;number&quot;, &quot;title&quot;, &quot;airdate&quot;),
           sep = &#39;\n\n&#39;) %&gt;%
  # Remove quotes from all variables
  mutate(
    title = stringr::str_replace_all(title, &#39;\&quot;&#39;, &quot;&quot;),
    number = stringr::str_replace_all(number, &#39;\&quot;&#39;, &quot;&quot;),

<div id="proverb-text" class="section level3">
<h3>Proverb text</h3>
<p>I used a similar approach to clean the proverb data, taking every even row from the <code>tab</code> vector and again removing those proverbs from the live shows. Out of interest, I also created two additional variables, which count the number of characters and words in each proverb.</p>
<p>Once I had this done, I removed any leading and trailing newline characters (I needed to retain internal newline characters as some proverbs are list-like) and create a unique numeric ID for each episode, as the <code>number</code> variable often had part indicators (19A and 19B). Finally, I merged the proverb data with the meta-data obtained above to create the final dataset.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>proverb_df &lt;- tab[-1] %&gt;%
  # Convert vector to dataframe
  data.frame(proverb = .) %&gt;%

  # Remove proverbs from live shows

    proverb_len_word = str_count(proverb, &#39;\\w+&#39;)

  # Clear random newlines at start and end of proverbs
  mutate(
    proverb = str_replace(proverb, &quot;\n\n$&quot;, &quot;&quot;),
    proverb = str_replace(proverb, &quot;\n$&quot;, &quot;&quot;),
    proverb = str_replace(proverb, &quot;^\n&quot;, &quot;&quot;)
  ) %&gt;%

<h2>Get a random proverb</h2>
<p>The last thing to do was to create a little function that returns a nicely formatted version of a random proverb or of a certain proverb given an ID.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>nightvale_proverb &lt;- function(id) {

# If an ID is provided, use that
# If not, get a random ID
if (!hasArg(id)) {

# Format the resulting message

        &quot;\n    -- \&quot;&quot;,
        proverb_df$title[id],

<p>And that’s it - a fun half-hour exercise, and an excuse to do some webscraping and data-cleaning. I plan to convert this into a small little GitHub-only package in the future, but it might not be for a while. So for now…</p>

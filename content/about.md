Luke McGuinness is an NIHR Doctoral Research Fellow at the University of Bristol, where he works with large bibliographic and electronic health record (EHR) datasets to investigate the effect of blood lipid levels on dementia. An R (pronounced ["oar"](/2019/01/01/r-vs-r/)) advocate, he is also interested in building open source tools to improve research transparency and reproducibility.

This blog is mainly a way for him to explain things to himself, though he hopes some of it might be of use to others.

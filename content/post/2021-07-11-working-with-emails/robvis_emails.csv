Thanks so much for your help.
Sorry for not replying sooner, I was still trying to wrestle with how best to present my data....we've included studies which have compared up to four tests, all containing different combinations and we were going to do a latent class analysis (w/o) a reference standard (although that has fallen by the wayside....)
Anyway, I think I've arranged the data (finally how I want it), and decided to put all the studies in the same figure irrespective of the number of tests or the combination of tests.
Ideally I wouldn't have an ""overall"" column on the figure....so I was wondering whether I could be really cheeky and ask for the premium in house service? (If I had photoshop/illustrator I would just crop the figure nicely...) And if I am being super cheeky whether you think we could accommodate much longer study names than usual (because I would like to include the tests that each study is comparing), and possibly changing the headings?
Because I've stuck all the studies in one table I do have some not applicable columns for some studies (i.e. the ones with only two tests don't have assessments for tests three and four).
I know you have LOADS on at the moment so no worries if this is a favour too far- I will just make do with the output from robvis no problem ?? But if sometime in the next two weeks you think you might be able to do this for me that would be epic ????
Hopefully everything is in the attached excel spreadsheet- two sheets of interest for you, the risk of bias and the applicability sheets (which are just copied from the ""all"" sheet).

Hi Alex, 

 

Haha, not to worry - the error is to do with the fact that you don’t have an “Overall” column in your dataset. Because the “Generic” template can handle a varying number of user-specified domains, it needs some way to know where the start (“Study” column) and end (“Overall” column) of these domains are, so the template won’t work if you do not have an “Overall” column.

 

A good solution might be to include the Overall column and mark it as “Not applicable”, which greys it out (see your example dataset and resulting image, attached), and then explain in your caption that an overall judgement is not applicable. Alternatively, if you send me your data, I can make you a custom plot without the Overall column (the premium in-house service, only available to those I like ??)?

 

Hope this helps,

 

Luke

Hi Luke,

If I'm trying to use robvis to generate some QUADAS-2 plots, would you suggest generating separate plots using the generic option to create plots for both risk of bias and applicability?

(I'm thinking that I will probably end up using the generic option in any case because I have fiddled with QUADAS-2 because some studies have multiple index tests, and we haven't designated a reference standard....)

Sorry this is prob obvious and I should just get on and create plots!

Hi Alex, 

 

Attached is an example output for the Risk of Bias spreadsheet. Is this kinda what you were thinking? If so, let me know and I’ll do the sample for the Applicability. Or if you’d like any changes, let me know!

 

One alternative (and this is just a suggestion), is to have a column per unique test and then use “Not applicable” to indicate when that test was not used in a particular study? This would reduce the length of the study names and increase the number of columns, which might look better? 

 

All the best,

No problem at all – it always helps to not have spent ages with the data already! I’ve attached an example of what I was thinking using the first two studies (I’ve left the tests in the Study name column to demonstrate it, but in the real thing you’d remove them).

Hi Alex, 

 

That is a lot more unique tests (and therefore columns) than I was expecting! ?? I’ve attached an mock-up using the new Risk of Bias set-up for comparison (just to note, I haven’t spent long customising it, so it’s not what the final version could look like – in particular, splitting the caption into two columns and increasing the size of some of the text would make it look better).

 

Having had a look at this, I’m now not sure which set-up is better (sorry!). As an alternative, we could potentially look at aligning a table beside the original figure for you to capture the additional information (tests used/variants/etc)? 

 

I hope this helps!

No problem at all – it always helps to not have spent ages with the data already! I’ve attached an example of what I was thinking using the first two studies (I’ve left the tests in the Study name column to demonstrate it, but in the real thing you’d remove them).

 

Hope this helps!

That is a really great idea!

I'll think if there is a simple way to reformat the data and get back to you. 

See I spend ages thinking and then I send it to you and you come up with a brilliant idea super quickly.

Hi Alex, 

 

Attached is an example output for the Risk of Bias spreadsheet. Is this kinda what you were thinking? If so, let me know and I’ll do the sample for the Applicability. Or if you’d like any changes, let me know!

 

One alternative (and this is just a suggestion), is to have a column per unique test and then use “Not applicable” to indicate when that test was not used in a particular study? This would reduce the length of the study names and increase the number of columns, which might look better? 

 

All the best, 

 

Luke

Hi Luke,

Thanks so much for your help.

Sorry for not replying sooner, I was still trying to wrestle with how best to present my data....we've included studies which have compared up to four tests, all containing different combinations and we were going to do a latent class analysis (w/o) a reference standard (although that has fallen by the wayside....)

Anyway, I think I've arranged the data (finally how I want it), and decided to put all the studies in the same figure irrespective of the number of tests or the combination of tests.

Ideally I wouldn't have an ""overall"" column on the figure....so I was wondering whether I could be really cheeky and ask for the premium in house service? (If I had photoshop/illustrator I would just crop the figure nicely...) And if I am being super cheeky whether you think we could accommodate much longer study names than usual (because I would like to include the tests that each study is comparing), and possibly changing the headings?

Because I've stuck all the studies in one table I do have some not applicable columns for some studies (i.e. the ones with only two tests don't have assessments for tests three and four).

I know you have LOADS on at the moment so no worries if this is a favour too far- I will just make do with the output from robvis no problem ?? But if sometime in the next two weeks you think you might be able to do this for me that would be epic ????

Hopefully everything is in the attached excel spreadsheet- two sheets of interest for you, the risk of bias and the applicability sheets (which are just copied from the ""all"" sheet).

Thanks Luke!

Hi Alex, 

 

Haha, not to worry - the error is to do with the fact that you don’t have an “Overall” column in your dataset. Because the “Generic” template can handle a varying number of user-specified domains, it needs some way to know where the start (“Study” column) and end (“Overall” column) of these domains are, so the template won’t work if you do not have an “Overall” column.

 

A good solution might be to include the Overall column and mark it as “Not applicable”, which greys it out (see your example dataset and resulting image, attached), and then explain in your caption that an overall judgement is not applicable. Alternatively, if you send me your data, I can make you a custom plot without the Overall column (the premium in-house service, only available to those I like ??)?

 

Hope this helps,

 

Luke

Hi Luke,

If I'm trying to use robvis to generate some QUADAS-2 plots, would you suggest generating separate plots using the generic option to create plots for both risk of bias and applicability?

(I'm thinking that I will probably end up using the generic option in any case because I have fiddled with QUADAS-2 because some studies have multiple index tests, and we haven't designated a reference standard....)

Sorry this is prob obvious and I should just get on and create plots!

Hi Luke, 





I am having issues with downloading the graphics after I generate them. I generated the graphics with the generic assessment tool. When I download, the legend text on the traffic light plot overlaps. When I download the weighted summary plot, the majority of the figure is cut off. I have tried downloading in multiple different formats, but am preferably trying to download in .eps. I would appreciate any suggestions you may have to resolve this issue. 





Thanks,

I think you are right about trying to cut down the length of the study names for Hantanpaa...........could we just cut it down to ""assay development"" and ""blinded validation""- that should cut the width of the column in half. I know they are still long but I already have quite a few notes for the caption.

Hi Alex, 

 

I think it is definitely looking better now.

 

Please find attached a sample image for the “Risk of bias_v3_Main table”. I wanted to make sure you are happy with it before doing the rest! I think I addressed all of your requirements, but please let me know if I missed anything. The only thing I might recommend is changing the Hatanpaa studies to Hatanpaa 2030 (i) and Hatanpaa 2030 (ii), and then explaining what the difference is in the figure caption (and then doing the same for the Sim 2018 paper, thus reducing the width of the study ID column.

 

Anyways, let me know what you think! If you are happy, I can do the rest pretty much straightaway.

Hi Alex, 

 

Attached is an example output for the Risk of Bias spreadsheet. Is this kinda what you were thinking? If so, let me know and I’ll do the sample for the Applicability. Or if you’d like any changes, let me know!

 

One alternative (and this is just a suggestion), is to have a column per unique test and then use “Not applicable” to indicate when that test was not used in a particular study? This would reduce the length of the study names and increase the number of columns, which might look better? 

 

All the best, 

 

Luke

Hi Luke,

Thanks so much for your help.

Sorry for not replying sooner, I was still trying to wrestle with how best to present my data....we've included studies which have compared up to four tests, all containing different combinations and we were going to do a latent class analysis (w/o) a reference standard (although that has fallen by the wayside....)

Anyway, I think I've arranged the data (finally how I want it), and decided to put all the studies in the same figure irrespective of the number of tests or the combination of tests.

Ideally I wouldn't have an ""overall"" column on the figure....so I was wondering whether I could be really cheeky and ask for the premium in house service? (If I had photoshop/illustrator I would just crop the figure nicely...) And if I am being super cheeky whether you think we could accommodate much longer study names than usual (because I would like to include the tests that each study is comparing), and possibly changing the headings?

Because I've stuck all the studies in one table I do have some not applicable columns for some studies (i.e. the ones with only two tests don't have assessments for tests three and four).

I know you have LOADS on at the moment so no worries if this is a favour too far- I will just make do with the output from robvis no problem ?? But if sometime in the next two weeks you think you might be able to do this for me that would be epic ????

Hopefully everything is in the attached excel spreadsheet- two sheets of interest for you, the risk of bias and the applicability sheets (which are just copied from the ""all"" sheet).

Thanks Luke!

Hi Alex, 

 

Haha, not to worry - the error is to do with the fact that you don’t have an “Overall” column in your dataset. Because the “Generic” template can handle a varying number of user-specified domains, it needs some way to know where the start (“Study” column) and end (“Overall” column) of these domains are, so the template won’t work if you do not have an “Overall” column.

 

A good solution might be to include the Overall column and mark it as “Not applicable”, which greys it out (see your example dataset and resulting image, attached), and then explain in your caption that an overall judgement is not applicable. Alternatively, if you send me your data, I can make you a custom plot without the Overall column (the premium in-house service, only available to those I like ??)?

 

Hope this helps,

 

Luke

Thank you so much that looks fab.

I think you are right about trying to cut down the length of the study names for Hantanpaa...........could we just cut it down to ""assay development"" and ""blinded validation""- that should cut the width of the column in half. I know they are still long but I already have quite a few notes for the caption.

Thanks SO much!

Hi Alex, 

 

I think it is definitely looking better now.

 

Please find attached a sample image for the “Risk of bias_v3_Main table”. I wanted to make sure you are happy with it before doing the rest! I think I addressed all of your requirements, but please let me know if I missed anything. The only thing I might recommend is changing the Hatanpaa studies to Hatanpaa 2030 (i) and Hatanpaa 2030 (ii), and then explaining what the difference is in the figure caption (and then doing the same for the Sim 2018 paper, thus reducing the width of the study ID column.

 

Anyways, let me know what you think! If you are happy, I can do the rest pretty much straightaway.

 

All the best, 

 

Luke

Righty-ho Luke I think we might have a plan.

(Haha that paper that says you can do a SR in 2 weeks? That is how long it takes me to figure out how to present my RoB assessments!)

So we are going to stick with your idea, but we are going to make a separate table for the studies which just compared types of FISH, and I had two studies which compared different variants of PCR and I've just put them in one column (and added a symbol to the study name for me to add a note to the legend). In any case I've got rid of 5 almost empty columns in the main table so hopefully it will look better as a figure (although there are still a lot of columns...).

Hopefully I've not made too much of a mess when sorting this out, but tabs of interest are Risk of bias_v3_Main table; Risk of bias_v3_FISH; Applicability_v3_Main table; Applicability_v3_FISH.

Ignore the key bit- as I said that is for me to insert details into the caption.

 

Luke I really appreciate all the help. I'm going to be super cheeky, in case it is easy for you to change, but I don't want to take up too much of your time and you really can tell me no and I'll be (more than) happy with whatever figure you produce...but in an ideal world...could I have the study names left justified? And is there any possibility that instead of D1 etc you could put the column labels in the figure, perhaps vertically? I should imagine my first request is easier than the second, and really it doesn't matter in any case.

 

Thanks again Luke, and hopefully your not regretting too much saying you could help me....(!)

Hi Alex, 

 

That is a lot more unique tests (and therefore columns) than I was expecting! ?? I’ve attached an mock-up using the new Risk of Bias set-up for comparison (just to note, I haven’t spent long customising it, so it’s not what the final version could look like – in particular, splitting the caption into two columns and increasing the size of some of the text would make it look better).

 

Having had a look at this, I’m now not sure which set-up is better (sorry!). As an alternative, we could potentially look at aligning a table beside the original figure for you to capture the additional information (tests used/variants/etc)? 

 

I hope this helps!

Hi Luke,

So I've been fighting with my data as I wanted to be able to transform it all using excel formulas to minimise the risk that I introduce errors but that has taken me ages and I couldn't work out how to do it for some at all....

Anyway, I've got some data tables together finally. The tabs of interest are ""Risk of bias_v2"" and ""Applicability_v2""

Urgh I don't know what to do because actually I have a load of columns because there are a lot of tests. It is also complicated because some of the studies compared variants of the same tests. I've highlighted these ones red. I don't know what you think- I could make a separate table with those that have variants- that would reduce the number of columns?

If it won't take you too much time do you mind making a mock up of a figure with this data and I can then ask Julian which he prefers. 

Thanks,

Alex

Hi Sam, 

 

Thanks for your mail. 

 

The issue is due to the very long titles of some of your domains, which the app was not originally designed to handle. I’ve pushed a fix to the app now which will allow you to use long domain titles in the traffic light plot without them overlapping with the legend (see the attached image, which was generated using your dataset and the web-app). As you have a large number of studies, I would recommend setting the point size argument to 5 – it will help to reduce the size of the image (I’ve done this in the attached image).

 

Note that this fix will not work for the weighted bar plot. As allowing very long titles would make the resulting image look very strange, I think your best bet is to rename the Domains with an indicator (e.g. Q1/Q2 . . .Q5) and then manually describe the full Domain titles in the figure caption. As an example, please see the attached edited version of your file and the resulting bar-plot.

 

Hope this helps, and please do let me know if you have any further questions. Finally, a friendly reminder that if you use robvis to produce figures for a manuscript, please consider citing the tool as this will help me justify spending time on adding extra features. Citation details for robvis can be found on the “About” page of the web-app <https://mcguinlu.shinyapps.io/robvis/> .

 

All the best,

Hi Luke, 

 

I am having issues with downloading the graphics after I generate them. I generated the graphics with the generic assessment tool. When I download, the legend text on the traffic light plot overlaps. When I download the weighted summary plot, the majority of the figure is cut off. I have tried downloading in multiple different formats, but am preferably trying to download in .eps. I would appreciate any suggestions you may have to resolve this issue.

	Dear Luke, 

	 

	I am writing to report an error. I am writing a systemic review, I attempt to use your tool for visualization of my graph. I downloaded the generic version you have provided and adjust it for my data. However, when I attempt to generate the graph, it tells me there is an error and I should contact you. I have attached the file I try to upload below for your attention. I like to take this opportunity to thank you for your splendid website and tool, It is very much appreciated.

I am a professor at the Federal University of Santa Maria, in southern Brazil. I have been working with systematic reviews and recently met the Robvis package...

First, I would like to thank and congratulate for the Robvis package for R. I heard about it and I'm trying to use it. 
I'd like to ask a question, if possible, which I did not understand properly. In the ""data_rob2"" database, how do we calculate the ""Weight measure for each study"" in the last collun, to structure a database to graph the risk of bias? If you can help me with this explanation, I would be very grateful. 

Thank so much for the attention,

I am a current MSc Public Health student at the university and I am currently in the process of completing my dissertation.  

I am carrying out a rapid review into smoking and the risk of meningococcal disease in adolescents and young adults and I have used an adapted version of the ROBINS-I tool to assess the risk of bias in my studies. As part of the adaption, domain 4 was omitted as it is not relevant to non-randomised studies of exposures. I have used the robvis tool to visualise my assessments, however because an assessment for all domains is needed to use the tool, I inputted “No information” into domain 4 and have included a footnote to say that I was unable to assess domain 4. However, I am worried this may be misleading.  

I got your email from my supervisor, Clare French, as she said you may know of a better solution?

Hi Martin, 

 

The horizontal labels is a known bug, and can be fixed by updating your version of the ggplot2 package. See here <https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmcguinlu%2Frobvis%2Fissues%2F81&data=02%7C01%7C%7C3a11ab5780664758a03208d842a2316d%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637332611688712164&sdata=2cqKuQMJfLJnfzfWZK%2FQCPGxAVDW9EgSfwiXSQyx5Ng%3D&reserved=0>  for more details.

 

Secondly, I am not sure I see the issue with the image you sent. The symbols appear centred and the resolution looks high – perhaps it is a limitation of the picture viewing app you have on your PC? The robvis R package produces the plots on the web application, so there should not be any discrepancy between them. 

 

Hope this helps, and please do let me know if you have any further questions. Finally, a friendly reminder that if you use robvis to produce figures for a manuscript, please consider citing the tool as this will help me justify spending time on adding extra features.

I appreciate the availability of the ROBVIS tool, which is being very useful.

However, I have a doubt regarding the ""traffic light plot"". When I generate the graph in R, the studies' identifiers are vertical (As indicated by the blue arrow in the attached figure) and I would like it to be horizontal.

For that, I tried the following adaptation in the code:


rob_traffic_light(data = my_rob_data, 

                  tool = ""ROB2"",
                  psize = 10)+
                  theme(strip.text.y = ggplot2::element_text
                        (angle = 180,
                        vjust = 1,    
                        hjust= 0,      
                        size = 8))  

I was able to adjust the font and point sizes but when I change its angle (I tried 180, 90, 45, and 0) nothing happens. I also tried some modifications at the angles directly in the codes of the ""rob_traffic_light"" function, but I was not successful.

********************

The member of Japanese COVID-19 guideline development (Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine [JSICM], Japanese Association for Acute Medicine [JAAM]?Chief: Kazuma Yamakawa [Department of Emergency Medicine, Osaka Medical College]) and I (participating as GRADE methodologist) are currently making ""living recommendations for COIVD-19"".

In our guideline development process, we are making RoB tables using ""robvis"" in ROBINS-I assessment (Intervention: Tocilizumab). 

Our guidelines will be completed by the end of this month, so I hope we can report the final product to you next month (unfortunately only in Japanese at the moment, sorry).

In Japan, however, I think that the use of ""Risk-of-bias VISualization (robvis)"" or ""Shiny-web-app of robvis"" will surely increase.

Hope you had a lovely break.
Sorry to bother you again with this but I realised that I had been an absolute div and managed to omit one of my tests from what I sent you to create the QUADAS-2 tables.
I was wondering whether you had time/wouldn't mind just updating the ""main"" Risk of bias and applicability tables for me? They are in the v3 tabs as before (Risk of bias_v3_Main table and Applicability_v3_Main table).
Hopefully I haven't made any other mistakes...
No rush btw- it would be great to have them by the end of the week but if you don't have time then no problem.
Thanks so much.

These look fab. I'm not sure exactly how Cochrane are going to manage with the massive images but I suppose at least they are unlikely to be doing print versions since I think it is all online!

One small thing...for the applicability plots could it say Applicability domains (rather than risk of bias?)

Luke you are a diamond!

Thank you so much that looks fab.

I think you are right about trying to cut down the length of the study names for Hantanpaa...........could we just cut it down to ""assay development"" and ""blinded validation""- that should cut the width of the column in half. I know they are still long but I already have quite a few notes for the caption.

Thanks SO much!

Hi Alex, 

 

I think it is definitely looking better now.

 

Please find attached a sample image for the “Risk of bias_v3_Main table”. I wanted to make sure you are happy with it before doing the rest! I think I addressed all of your requirements, but please let me know if I missed anything. The only thing I might recommend is changing the Hatanpaa studies to Hatanpaa 2030 (i) and Hatanpaa 2030 (ii), and then explaining what the difference is in the figure caption (and then doing the same for the Sim 2018 paper, thus reducing the width of the study ID column.

 

Anyways, let me know what you think! If you are happy, I can do the rest pretty much straightaway.

 

All the best, 

 

Luke

(Haha that paper that says you can do a SR in 2 weeks? That is how long it takes me to figure out how to present my RoB assessments!)

So we are going to stick with your idea, but we are going to make a separate table for the studies which just compared types of FISH, and I had two studies which compared different variants of PCR and I've just put them in one column (and added a symbol to the study name for me to add a note to the legend). In any case I've got rid of 5 almost empty columns in the main table so hopefully it will look better as a figure (although there are still a lot of columns...).

Hopefully I've not made too much of a mess when sorting this out, but tabs of interest are Risk of bias_v3_Main table; Risk of bias_v3_FISH; Applicability_v3_Main table; Applicability_v3_FISH.

Ignore the key bit- as I said that is for me to insert details into the caption.

 

Luke I really appreciate all the help. I'm going to be super cheeky, in case it is easy for you to change, but I don't want to take up too much of your time and you really can tell me no and I'll be (more than) happy with whatever figure you produce...but in an ideal world...could I have the study names left justified? And is there any possibility that instead of D1 etc you could put the column labels in the figure, perhaps vertically? I should imagine my first request is easier than the second, and really it doesn't matter in any case.

 

Thanks again Luke, and hopefully your not regretting too much saying you could help me....(!)

Hi Alex, 

 

That is a lot more unique tests (and therefore columns) than I was expecting! ?? I’ve attached an mock-up using the new Risk of Bias set-up for comparison (just to note, I haven’t spent long customising it, so it’s not what the final version could look like – in particular, splitting the caption into two columns and increasing the size of some of the text would make it look better).

 

Having had a look at this, I’m now not sure which set-up is better (sorry!). As an alternative, we could potentially look at aligning a table beside the original figure for you to capture the additional information (tests used/variants/etc)? 

 

I hope this helps!

Hi Luke,

So I've been fighting with my data as I wanted to be able to transform it all using excel formulas to minimise the risk that I introduce errors but that has taken me ages and I couldn't work out how to do it for some at all....

Anyway, I've got some data tables together finally. The tabs of interest are ""Risk of bias_v2"" and ""Applicability_v2""

Urgh I don't know what to do because actually I have a load of columns because there are a lot of tests. It is also complicated because some of the studies compared variants of the same tests. I've highlighted these ones red. I don't know what you think- I could make a separate table with those that have variants- that would reduce the number of columns?

If it won't take you too much time do you mind making a mock up of a figure with this data and I can then ask Julian which he prefers. 

Thanks,

Alex

Hi Alex, 

 

Attached is an example output for the Risk of Bias spreadsheet. Is this kinda what you were thinking? If so, let me know and I’ll do the sample for the Applicability. Or if you’d like any changes, let me know!

 

One alternative (and this is just a suggestion), is to have a column per unique test and then use “Not applicable” to indicate when that test was not used in a particular study? This would reduce the length of the study names and increase the number of columns, which might look better? 

 

All the best,

Hi Luke,

Thanks so much for your help.

Sorry for not replying sooner, I was still trying to wrestle with how best to present my data....we've included studies which have compared up to four tests, all containing different combinations and we were going to do a latent class analysis (w/o) a reference standard (although that has fallen by the wayside....)

Anyway, I think I've arranged the data (finally how I want it), and decided to put all the studies in the same figure irrespective of the number of tests or the combination of tests.

Ideally I wouldn't have an ""overall"" column on the figure....so I was wondering whether I could be really cheeky and ask for the premium in house service? (If I had photoshop/illustrator I would just crop the figure nicely...) And if I am being super cheeky whether you think we could accommodate much longer study names than usual (because I would like to include the tests that each study is comparing), and possibly changing the headings?

Because I've stuck all the studies in one table I do have some not applicable columns for some studies (i.e. the ones with only two tests don't have assessments for tests three and four).

I know you have LOADS on at the moment so no worries if this is a favour too far- I will just make do with the output from robvis no problem ?? But if sometime in the next two weeks you think you might be able to do this for me that would be epic ????

Hopefully everything is in the attached excel spreadsheet- two sheets of interest for you, the risk of bias and the applicability sheets (which are just copied from the ""all"" sheet).

Thanks Luke!

Hi Alex, 

 

Haha, not to worry - the error is to do with the fact that you don’t have an “Overall” column in your dataset. Because the “Generic” template can handle a varying number of user-specified domains, it needs some way to know where the start (“Study” column) and end (“Overall” column) of these domains are, so the template won’t work if you do not have an “Overall” column.

 

A good solution might be to include the Overall column and mark it as “Not applicable”, which greys it out (see your example dataset and resulting image, attached), and then explain in your caption that an overall judgement is not applicable. Alternatively, if you send me your data, I can make you a custom plot without the Overall column (the premium in-house service, only available to those I like ??)?

 

Hope this helps,

 

Luke

Me again,

I'm prob being a div but I tried various combinations and I can't figure out what the issue is...

I'm getting an error, but it is blank after the phrase ""the error is:""

I've attached my ""test"" data- only one line! 

I've tried unclear/some concerns with no success.

Sorry Luke there is probably an incredibly obvious reason for the error...

Hi Luke,

If I'm trying to use robvis to generate some QUADAS-2 plots, would you suggest generating separate plots using the generic option to create plots for both risk of bias and applicability?

(I'm thinking that I will probably end up using the generic option in any case because I have fiddled with QUADAS-2 because some studies have multiple index tests, and we haven't designated a reference standard....)

Sorry this is prob obvious and I should just get on and create plots!

Hi Luke,

Hope you had a lovely break.

Sorry to bother you again with this but I realised that I had been an absolute div and managed to omit one of my tests from what I sent you to create the QUADAS-2 tables.

I was wondering whether you had time/wouldn't mind just updating the ""main"" Risk of bias and applicability tables for me? They are in the v3 tabs as before (Risk of bias_v3_Main table and Applicability_v3_Main table).

Hopefully I haven't made any other mistakes...

No rush btw- it would be great to have them by the end of the week but if you don't have time then no problem.

Thanks so much.

Alex

These look fab. I'm not sure exactly how Cochrane are going to manage with the massive images but I suppose at least they are unlikely to be doing print versions since I think it is all online!

One small thing...for the applicability plots could it say Applicability domains (rather than risk of bias?)

Luke you are a diamond!

Thank you so much that looks fab.

I think you are right about trying to cut down the length of the study names for Hantanpaa...........could we just cut it down to ""assay development"" and ""blinded validation""- that should cut the width of the column in half. I know they are still long but I already have quite a few notes for the caption.

Thanks SO much!

Hi Alex, 

 

I think it is definitely looking better now.

 

Please find attached a sample image for the “Risk of bias_v3_Main table”. I wanted to make sure you are happy with it before doing the rest! I think I addressed all of your requirements, but please let me know if I missed anything. The only thing I might recommend is changing the Hatanpaa studies to Hatanpaa 2030 (i) and Hatanpaa 2030 (ii), and then explaining what the difference is in the figure caption (and then doing the same for the Sim 2018 paper, thus reducing the width of the study ID column.

 

Anyways, let me know what you think! If you are happy, I can do the rest pretty much straightaway.

 

All the best,

Because the “Generic” template can handle a varying number of user-specified domains, it needs some way to know where the start (“Study” column) and end (“Overall” column) of these domains are, so the template won’t work if you do not have an “Overall” column.

 

A good solution might be to include the Overall column and mark it as “Not applicable”, which greys it out (see your example dataset and resulting image, attached), and then explain in your caption that an overall judgement is not applicable. Alternatively, if you send me your data, I can make you a custom plot without the Overall column (the premium in-house service, only available to those I like ??)?

 

Hope this helps,

 

Luke

Me again,

I'm prob being a div but I tried various combinations and I can't figure out what the issue is...

I'm getting an error, but it is blank after the phrase ""the error is:""

I've attached my ""test"" data- only one line! 

I've tried unclear/some concerns with no success.

Sorry Luke there is probably an incredibly obvious reason for the error...

Ta,

Alex

Subject: Quick question RE robvis 

 

Hi Luke,

If I'm trying to use robvis to generate some QUADAS-2 plots, would you suggest generating separate plots using the generic option to create plots for both risk of bias and applicability?

(I'm thinking that I will probably end up using the generic option in any case because I have fiddled with QUADAS-2 because some studies have multiple index tests, and we haven't designated a reference standard....)

Sorry this is prob obvious and I should just get on and create plots!

Ta,

Alex

Hi Ellie, 

 

To my mind your best option would be to use the “Generic” template on the web-app and remove Domain 4 entirely, and just include something like the following in the title of the figure and/or the Methods section: “Risk of bias assessments were performed using an adapted version of the ROBINS-I assessment tool, as <description of why Domain 4 is not applicable.>”

 

I have attached the basic template you will need to use with your adapted version. Note that when using the “Generic” template, the names of the domains need to be the column headings – in this case, the remaining 6 domains of the ROBINS-I tool are the column headings. One other stumbling block is that for the “Generic” template, you will have to replace all “Serious” risk of bias judgements with “High” in your Excel sheet in order for it to be accepted by the web-app. On a related point, you will have to rename two judgements labels once you have generated your figure in the app, so that they agree with the ROBINS-I labels: “High” -> “Serious”, and “Some concerns” -> “Moderate”. This should be straightforward using the app’s interface.

 

The attached figure was produced using the attached template, and by renaming the judgment labels as described.

 

Hope this helps, and please do let me know if you have any further questions. Finally, a friendly reminder that if you use robvis to produce figures for your dissertation, please consider citing the tool. Citation details for robvis can be found on the “About” page of the web-app <https://mcguinlu.shinyapps.io/robvis/> .

Hi Luke,  

I am a current MSc Public Health student at the university and I am currently in the process of completing my dissertation.  

I am carrying out a rapid review into smoking and the risk of meningococcal disease in adolescents and young adults and I have used an adapted version of the ROBINS-I tool to assess the risk of bias in my studies. As part of the adaption, domain 4 was omitted as it is not relevant to non-randomised studies of exposures. I have used the robvis tool to visualise my assessments, however because an assessment for all domains is needed to use the tool, I inputted “No information” into domain 4 and have included a footnote to say that I was unable to assess domain 4. However, I am worried this may be misleading.  

I got your email from my supervisor, Clare French, as she said you may know of a better solution?  

Kind regards,  

Ellie Pilat

	The horizontal labels is a known bug, and can be fixed by updating your version of the ggplot2 package.

Hi Steph, 

 

Thanks for your mail  - glad that you are finding the tool helpful!

 

Hah, I can’t believe no-one else has spotted that yet – thank you very much for flagging it. Unfortunately, due to the fact that a larger overhaul of the code powering the Shiny app (which I what I presume is what you are using?) is currently underway, it’s not a straightforward fix right now. However, I have created an GitHub Issue both to remind me to fix it once things settle down and so that you can keep an eye on progress, which can be found here: https://github.com/mcguinlu/robvis/issues/95 <https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__github.com_mcguinlu_robvis_issues_95&d=DwMGaQ&c=sJ6xIWYx-zLMB3EPkvcnVg&r=D2F3v1zXEOssYHaoxYlI9cJ-2_bJNPh8hWfGe9r7jG8&m=-AojG14zPIg-ePqXDN3jScMljUekW6Z8pxX-AU4WALQ&s=xcA38hYnhQAHyezz0lRmO9Zg4xVs9OoVNyi-Qpu4JY4&e=>

For plotting the risk of bias in the robvis, which is the best one to select in the ""select assessment tool"" drop-down? 

Secondly from just using some of them to see what happens, they need an ""overall"" column or a ""weight"" column, it suggests just putting N/a for these, however, I didn't know if that's ok as I have no clue what overall/weight are looking for? 

Attached is what I've done with it so far, but obviously lacking any information on the 'overall' column, it is also done using the generic assessment tool, which as said I'm unsure if this is correct. 

Any advice would be great!! 

Many Thanks,

Robvis is only designed to work with a single column for each domain, as this is what the tools themselves use, so it will not be able to help you here. Similarly, I don’t know of another tool that would allow you to achieve what you want. Out of interest, what is the rationale behind having two columns for each domain?

Hi,

 

I wanted to have two columns for each domain in QUADAS-2.  However, when I upload my document, the website will not let me generate the plots because of an incorrect number of columns.  

 

How can I solve the issue?  

 

If this issue cannot be solved, do you know of another tool that can help me out?

	Hi Jacob, 

	 

	No problem at all!

	 

	At present, robvis doesn’t offer anything to combine different tools, and so your best bet is to combine the different figures with Paint (though I personally prefer presenting them as individual figures). 

	 

	I would be interested in seeing what the final combined plot that you are submitting to PLOS One looks like, so that I can assess whether robvis could offer some similar functionality in the future. Is it possible for you to forward on a copy of the combined figure in confidence?

	 

	All the best, and a Happy New Year to you too,

		Dear mr McGuinnes,

		 

		First I have to thank you for the amazing visualization tool that's available on robvis.

		I am using it for the publication of a systematic review. 

		 

		I found a small problem in the generation of a generic traffic-light plot.

		 

		The label `Risk of bias´ is placed where it should say: study.

		Could you please solve this problem?

		 

		I paste the image below.

		 

		

		 

		Thank you so much,

		 

		Jacob Bezemer

Thanks for all your help.

I just note that on the traffic light lot, the grey circles are labelled “no information” rather than “not applicable”.  

Also on the summary plot, there is no information about “not applicable”.

Have I done something wrong or is it something you do?

 

With thanks,

Apologies for emailing you on this email but I had not received a reply from an email I sent to risk-of-bias@bristol.ac.uk <mailto:risk-of-bias@bristol.ac.uk>   

I have been using the ROBVIS graphic tool successfully in the past month but yesterday I don’t seem to be getting past the “Please Wait” prompt. I have tried the same URL on other browsers with the same results.

 

Please can you advise? It is such a great tool and I would like to continue using and recommending it!

I’m a PhD researcher at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in the US. First, thank you for creating the Shiny web app so that I can create the robvis without having to learn R – although I did spend about 2-3 hours to trying to figure it out by myself before I found the Shiny web app. For my systematic review, we utilized Covidence <https://www.covidence.org/>  for data extraction and quality assessments. The quality assessment ratings in Covidence were based on the Cochrane’s RoB (not RoB2) so there are some additional domains not included in robvis and the ratings are: high, low, and unsure. Is there a way to make the Shiny web app editable to include these additional domains and change the ratings or would you suggest I try to do this in R?

 

Thanks for your guidance on this,

Noy

I’m definitely the right person to contact about this. 

 

Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to reproduce the issue locally – when I browse to the tool in both Chrome and Internet Explorer, it loads up without issue. Do you think you could send me a screenshot of what it looks like for you when visit to https://mcguinlu.shinyapps.io/robvis/ <https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmcguinlu.shinyapps.io%2Frobvis%2F&data=04%7C01%7Cn.strobel%40ecu.edu.au%7C99ea7c9ac5e546e0cf8f08d8e46f70d9%7C9bcb323d7fa345e7a36f6d9cfdbcc272%7C1%7C0%7C637510514599059203%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=SflHitgIOLZpAphGdCV3vddiXmduXsmJmD4GvBNuoH8%3D&reserved=0> ?

Hi Lucia, 

 

Thanks for your mail. I think the issue is that the online tool is case-sensitive, and expects the first letter of each judgement to be capitalised (i.e. it expects “No information” rather than “no information”). 

 

Thanks for flagging this issue – I’ll add new functionality sometime soon so that the data validation aspect is not so strict!

 

Hope this helps, and please do let me know if you have any further questions. Finally, a friendly reminder that if you use robvis to produce figures for a manuscript, please consider citing the tool as this will help me justify spending time on adding extra features. Citation details for robvis can be found on the “About” page of the web-app <https://mcguinlu.shinyapps.io/robvis/> .

Thank you for creating the Robvis website! It is very helpful.

 

I have been trying to create a figure with “weight” data. I did not see a template with this option. I put the “weight” in the last column (study A has 256 subjects and Study B has 29 subjects). I tried to upload it and it seemed to work but generated an “error” when trying to create the figure. Could you let me know where I went wrong?

Thanks!!
Brian

[CAUTION: Non-UBC Email]

Hi Brian, 

 

Thanks for flagging this error – it was due to an issue with the weight data being passed to the function that creates the traffic light plot. I have fixed it now and confirmed it works with the data you provided, and it should now also be fixed in the live version of the app (I hope) – though please let me know if you continue to experience the error! 

 

Hope this helps, and please do let me know if you have any further questions. Finally, a friendly reminder that if you use robvis to produce figures for a manuscript, please consider citing the tool as this will help me justify spending time on adding extra features. Citation details for robvis can be found on the “About” page of the web-app <https://mcguinlu.shinyapps.io/robvis/> .

 

All the best, 

 

Luke

Hi Aileen, 

 

Glad you are finding the tool helpful ??

 

From an initial guess, I reckon you need the “Generic” template, which can handle any number of domains. Do you have an example dataset that I could use to illustrate this template?

 

All the best,

Subject: RE: Customisation of the Robvis Tool

 

Hi Alieen, 

 

Yep, you’ll need to use the “Generic” option – select it from the “Select assessment tool” drop-down box on the web-app.

 

The one other thing is that robvis doesn’t like empty cells, such as the first domain of Study 2 in your example data. The best option is to replace this empty cell with “Not applicable”, which results in a greyed out point (see the attached image, created using an updated version of your data with this change made, also attached).

 

Hope this helps, and please do let me know if you have any further questions. Finally, a friendly reminder that if you use robvis to produce figures for a manuscript, please consider citing the tool as this will help me justify spending time on adding extra features. Citation details for robvis can be found on the “About” page of the web-app <https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/3444CyojxQTrAoYmXuZ1uhV?domain=mcguinlu.shinyapps.io/> .

Having completed the new ROB 2 forms for 3 studies I have struggled to upload my data to robvis to create the traffic light table.

The new ROB 2 has an extra Domain 2 which doesn’t seen to be recognised by ROBVIS.

Domain 1: Risk of bias arising from the randomization process

Domain 2: Risk of bias due to deviations from the intended interventions (effect of assignment to intervention)

Domain 2: Risk of bias due to deviations from the intended interventions (effect of adhering to intervention)

Domain 3: Risk of bias due to missing outcome data

Domain 4: Risk of bias in measurement of the outcome

Domain 5: Risk of bias in selection of the reported result

Overall risk of bias

However ROBVIS will not allow me to enter a second Domain 2

I have attached by file and would be grateful for your help.

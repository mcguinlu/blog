<p>One of the packages I developed for creating publication quality risk-of-bias plots<span class="sidenote-number"></span><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://github.com/mcguinlu/robvis">robvis</a></span> has now been used in &gt;100 systematic reviews. The functionality is available as a R<span class="sidenote-number"></span><span class="sidenote">Pronounced <a href = "/2019/01/01/r-vs-r/">“oar”</a>.</span> package and as a Shiny web application.</p>
